# Introduction
This is a special project that we agreed on together with the TC head of the education department. This project is part of my master's thesis and homework on vision and perception
at the Sapienza University of Rome. In this project, I tried to create a multi classier that would classify images of fire, smoke and nothing. However, during the training
of my network, I had no other choice but to get rid of the smoke images only, because the results were very bad. Model remembered surrounding but not the smoke, I guess
this happened because the data was synthetic. Additional conclusions and results can be found in the notebook. Also in this repository you can find the py file with an additional
function, the model file and the requirements for the function file.
